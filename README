USAGE

	./phatELF.sh {infile} {outfile}

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

	There is no code to compile in order to run the script! All C++ code 
	is compiled at run-time. Simply run the phatELF.sh file with the 
	correct CLI arguments.

DESCRIPTION

	The approach I took was to copy the infile into an ELF section of the
	outfile so that the outfile could retrieve and execute it. In addition
	to executing the stored executable, the outfile also prints my four-
	digit uid 2423!

	Hope you enjoy this approach!
