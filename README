	ELF Padding with Executable Code! The concept is pretty simple, the 
	included script hides some executable in the newly created .phat ELF 
	section of another executable which is built durring script execution.
	The resulting executable runs some routine (in this case, a simple call
	to printf()), extracts the contents of the .phat ELF section, and 
	executes the extracted code.

	To put it simply, the resulting file should run this extra routine then
	behave exactly the same as the input file.

USAGE

	./phatELF.sh {infile} {outfile}

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

	There is no code to compile in order to run the script! All C++ code 
	is compiled at run-time. Simply run the phatELF.sh file with the 
	correct CLI arguments.

DESCRIPTION

	The approach I took was to copy the infile into an ELF section of the
	outfile so that the outfile could retrieve and execute it. In addition
	to executing the stored executable, the outfile also prints my four-
	digit uid 2423!

	Hope you enjoy this approach!
