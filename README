DESCRIPTION

	ELF Padding with Executable Code! The concept is pretty simple, the 
	included script hides some executable in the newly created .phat ELF 
	section of another executable which is built durring script execution.
	The resulting executable runs some routine (in this case, a simple call
	to printf()), extracts the contents of the .phat ELF section, and 
	executes the extracted code.

	To put it simply, the resulting file should run this extra routine then
	behave exactly the same as the input file.
